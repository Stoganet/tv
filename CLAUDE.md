# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

Native Android TV client for the stoganet ecosystem. **Kotlin + Compose-for-TV**, single Gradle
module (`:app`), manual DI via a `ServiceLocator`, MVI-lite (single `UiState` + `onIntent`) per
screen. Talks exclusively to `api-proxy` (`https://api.stoganet.com`) — never directly to
Jellyfin. Sibling repos: `api-proxy` (Go backend), `infra` (compose stack), `edge` (Caddy),
`stogad` (Rust host daemon).

## Key wiring

**Single Ktor `HttpClient`:** built by `HttpClientFactory.buildHttpClient(tokenStore)` with the
Ktor `Auth` plugin (bearer). `loadTokens` reads from `TokenStore`; `refreshTokens` posts to
`auth/refresh` and marks the request with `markAsRefreshTokenRequest()` so the Auth plugin does
not retry the refresh on a 401, preventing infinite loops. `sendWithoutRequest` is scoped to the
API host so the `Authorization` header is never sent to third-party URLs. The same client instance
is reused by Coil via `KtorNetworkFetcherFactory`.

**Two NavHosts:** `AuthNavHost` (no tokens → Quick Connect screen today) and `AppNavHost`
(authenticated → Home placeholder today). `MainActivity` reads `TokenStore` to decide which to
show.

**ServiceLocator graph:** `TokenStore` → `HttpClient` → `StoganetApi` → repositories. New
repositories should be added to `ServiceLocator` and wired there.

**OpenAPI client:** Generated from `openapi/openapi.yaml` (kept in sync with `api-proxy`'s spec)
via `./gradlew :app:openApiGenerate`. Output lands in `app/build/generated/openapi/`. When
`api-proxy` adds new endpoints, copy the updated spec here and regenerate before implementing
the repository method.

## Architecture invariants

These cross-file constraints matter when editing — violating any is a 🔴 Important in review:

- **`refreshTokens` calls `markAsRefreshTokenRequest()`** — without it, a 401 on the refresh
  request triggers another refresh attempt → infinite loop.
- **Token refresh is serialised by Ktor's `Auth` plugin** — N parallel 401s trigger exactly one
  `refreshTokens` call; the other N-1 see the new token and retry automatically.
- **All token access goes through `TokenStore`** (Proto DataStore + Tink). No raw
  `SharedPreferences`, no direct file I/O, no globals.
- **`UiState` is immutable** and updated only via `_state.update { it.copy(...) }`.
- **`UiState` data classes are annotated `@Immutable`** — tells the Compose compiler the type is
  stable, enables recomposition skipping.
- **Collections inside `UiState` are `ImmutableList` / `ImmutableMap`** from
  `kotlinx.collections.immutable`.
- **`ViewModel → Repository → generated ApiClient`** layering is one-way.
- **Composables never receive a `ViewModel` as a parameter.** The NavHost `composable {}` block
  owns ViewModel creation and state collection; it passes `state: UiState` and
  `onIntent: (Intent) -> Unit` to the screen composable. This keeps screens pure, previewable,
  and testable without Android framework dependencies.
- **Every screen composable has `@Preview` functions** for each meaningful UI state.
- **All interactive TV elements have an explicit `contentDescription`** via
  `Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = "..." }`. On TV, TalkBack reads `contentDescription`
  from the focusable element — child `Text` implicit labels are unreliable on D-pad focus.
- **Strings live in `res/values/strings.xml`.** No hardcoded user-visible English in Compose code.
- **No telemetry / crash reporting / analytics.**
- **CI actions are SHA-pinned**, never tag-pinned.

## Common operations

```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew detekt
./gradlew detekt --auto-correct
./gradlew :app:openApiGenerate
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

## Editing notes

- **Generated OpenAPI client (`app/build/generated/openapi/`) is never edited by hand.**
- **Android TV manifest is load-bearing.** Do not remove `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER`, the leanback
  `uses-feature`, the banner reference, or flip `allowBackup` to true.
- **ProGuard rules in `app/proguard-rules.pro`** are required for release builds.

## Stoganet conventions

Skills in `.claude/skills/` (if present) enforce the org-wide workflow — invoke them via the
Skill tool:

- **committing** — Conventional Commits; match the style used in `api-proxy`.
- **creating-pull-requests** — PR title becomes the squash-commit.
- **creating-issues** — Shared body template across all Stoganet repos.
- **handoff** — Use before context compaction when there's uncommitted work worth preserving.
